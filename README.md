## 🧠 About

With the rise of AI-generated media, detecting deepfakes has become critical for media integrity and combating misinformation. PixelTruth addresses this by providing a fast, accurate, and accessible deepfake detection tool built on deep learning.

It analyzes visual artifacts introduced during image synthesis and classifies images in real-time through an intuitive web dashboard.

## ✨ Features

- 🖼️ **Real-time image analysis** — supports JPG, PNG, WebP formats
- 📊 **Confidence scores** — shows probability of real vs. fake
- 🎨 **Modern Streamlit dashboard** — glassmorphism UI with visual feedback
- ⚡ **Fast inference** — lightweight model optimized for speed
- 🔬 **Custom preprocessing pipeline** — enhanced artifact detection

## 📐 Model Input & Preprocessing Contract

All models produced by training scripts and executed by inference pipelines comply with the **Canonical Model Version v1.0.0** contract. 

- **Model Version**: `v1.0.0` (MobileNetV2 backbone with embedded rescaling)
- **Raw Preprocessing**: Images are resized to **96x96 pixels** and converted to RGB order, with float32 pixel values kept in the range **`[0.0, 255.0]`**.
- **Internal Model Scaling**: The model embeds a Keras `Rescaling(scale=1./127.5, offset=-1.)` layer as its first preprocessing step. This maps the raw `[0.0, 255.0]` inputs to the range **`[-1.0, 1.0]`** (the canonical input range required by the pretrained MobileNetV2 backbone).
- **Consistency**: Both training-time generators and inference-time pipelines pass raw `[0.0, 255.0]` pixel values directly to the model, ensuring perfect compatibility between training and production environments.

## ⚙️ Installation

> **⚠️ Prerequisites:**
> - **Python Version:** This project strictly requires **Python 3.11**.
>   (Newer versions like Python 3.12 are currently incompatible with the required TensorFlow dependencies).

> - **Windows Users:** 
>   - You must have the [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe) installed to run TensorFlow.
>   - If the app crashes on launch with a DLL error, install `tensorflow-cpu` instead of standard `tensorflow`.

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Piyush-Sharma788/PixelTruth.git
cd PixelTruth

# 2. Create a virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# 3. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Model setup

PixelTruth also needs a trained model file before it can make predictions.

#### Option 1: automatic download on first run

Set a direct download URL for the trained model (for example, a GitHub Release asset) and the app will fetch it automatically when it starts:

```bash
export PIXELTRUTH_MODEL_URL=https://your-release-link/deepfake_detection_model.h5
export PIXELTRUTH_MODEL_SHA256=<optional-sha256>
streamlit run app.py
```

#### Option 2: manual download script

Download the model with the helper script:

```bash
python scripts/download_model.py --url https://your-release-link/deepfake_detection_model.h5 --dest deepfake_detection_model.h5
```

#### Option 3: place the file manually

1. Download or generate the trained Keras model.
2. Save it as `deepfake_detection_model.h5` in the project root, or set `PIXELTRUTH_MODEL_PATH` to the file location.
3. Restart the app after placing the model file.

If you keep the model in a different folder, export the path before launching Streamlit:

```bash
export PIXELTRUTH_MODEL_PATH=/full/path/to/deepfake_detection_model.h5
streamlit run app.py
```

If you receive the model from a release asset or shared download link, copy it into the project root first:

```bash
cp /path/to/downloaded/deepfake_detection_model.h5 ./deepfake_detection_model.h5
```

If you publish the model as a GitHub Release asset, the recommended setup is:

1. Upload `deepfake_detection_model.h5` to the release.
2. Copy the release asset URL into `PIXELTRUTH_MODEL_URL`.
3. Optionally record the SHA256 checksum in `PIXELTRUTH_MODEL_SHA256`.
4. Start the app with `streamlit run app.py`.

## 🚀 Usage

```bash
# Run the Streamlit dashboard
streamlit run app.py
```

Then open your browser at `http://localhost:8501`, upload an image, and get instant results.
